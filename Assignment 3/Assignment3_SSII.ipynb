Furthermore, the **value** of these gems is different, being even zero for some gems. In this updating of our problem, the episode ends when the agent enters in a cell ocuppied by a gem, regardless of its value.\n",

    "Thus, the maze is a grid of size N x M formed by a set of cells, some of which can be occupied by walls, which cannot be crossed. The rest of the cells will be empty and they will represent  free space. For now, the robot can only move horizontally or vertically. In addition, we can have cells with gems, being the goal of our robot to collect the one of highest value. "

    "## Implementation\n",
    "In the following cells, we provide you some classes and pieces of code that you will have to complete as a part of this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class `Problem`\n",
    "This class provides the **representation of the learning problem**. As you may notice, in this assignment, this class is a bit more complex than in the previous ones. The reason is that now we have to deal with an **uncertain environment**. \n",
    "\n",
    "It contains the size of the maze (`rows` and `cols`), the `initialState`, the `maze`, the `gems` positions, the `gemsRewards` and also the `moveProb` value, which codifies how uncertain is the environment. Thus, `moveProb=1.0` means a deterministic environment, but e.g. `moveProb=0.8` means that the selected action will be actually applied 80% of the times, while 20% of the times another possible action will be applied. You will have to implement some parts of this class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The class `Problem` also has some interesting methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `getPossibleActions(state)` will generate all the actions that can be applied in a given state. **You must code this method**. Notice that it is somehow similar to `getSucessors` in previous assignments. To make things easier we recommend programming this method to return a *pair of lists, where the first list will contain the possible actions, and the second list will contain the states reached with the actions from the first list*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `getTransitionDistribution(state, action)` will return the transition probability distribution when trying to apply action `action` in state `state`, as a *list of triplets, where each triplet consists of a possible action, the state that action leads to, and the probability to land on that state*. Take a look to the code to understand its meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `getReward(state)` returns *a number* representing the reward associated to the given state, regardless of whether it is a final state or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `applyAction(state, action)` returns the state obtained when we give the order to execute the action `action` in state `state`. However, because of the (probably) noisy environment, the result can be an unexpected outcome. This is the reason this method is now in the `Problem` class, because it needs to make use of the transition probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are some other useful methods in this class, we encourage you to take a look at them."
