    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Metaheuristic algorithms are often used to obtain good solutions for difficult problems. By difficult problems we mean: problems expressed as a *blackbox*, that is, problems for which its internal structure or definition is unknown; problems whose representation or evaluation is so complex that it is impossible to solve it using other algorithmic techniques; and problems for which even knowing its internal structure the number of configurations (potential solutions) is so large that the exact solution would be too costly even for small size instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, the two types of metaheuristic algorithms studied in class, namely *local search* and *genetic algorithms*, will be implemented. They will be used to solve a specific problem related to the search problem implemented in Assignment 2. Apart from studying the behavior of the algorithms and the influence that different parameters exert in the obtained solutions, different modifications can be proposed and implemented with the purpose of improving the accuracy (better solutions) and the efficiency (less evaluations, less time) of the implemented algorithms."

    "The maze is a grid of size N x M formed by a set of cells, some of which can be occupied by walls, which cannot be crossed. The rest of the cells will be empty and they will represent the free space. For now, the robot can only move horizontally or vertically. In addition, we can have cells with garbage, which must be cleaned by our agent, a vacuum cleaner robot."

    "The objective of our robot is to clean the whole area as fast as possible. In other words: **find the shortest path to find all the garbage cells in the environment**. In order to implement our robot we have to take into account that: \n",
    "- The robot can start in a random cell of the map.\n",
    "- The robot can move horizontally or vertically in the maze.\n",
    "- The robot can not cross walls or go beyond the limits of the maze.\n",
    "- The robot will have to clean all the garbage cells found in the map, which will be automatically cleaned as soon as the robot arrives to those cells.\n",
    "- For now, all the movements of the robot will have a cost of 1.\n",
    "- The search will finish once all garbage cells in the map have been cleaned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in this assignment the problem to solve consists on finding the order in which all the garbages should be cleaned (visited), starting from the initial position of the robot. Therefore every possible ordering of the garbages will be a possible solution to our problem, namely **configuration** in the following. As stated in Assignment 2, the A$^*$ search algorithm is the best option to find the shortest path between two points in a maze if we want to guarantee the optimality of the search process, which in addition is more efficient than UniformCost search (or BreadthFirst in our case, since all actions have a cost of 1). Then, in order to find the shortest path to find all the garbage cells in the environment we will apply the A$^*$ search iteratively from the initial position of the robot to the first garbage in the configuration, then to the second one, and so on until the last one.
